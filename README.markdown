# Tempus

This is a very simple space shooter written in coffeescript. It uses an html5 canvas for drawing and html5 audio tags for the audio. There currently is no permanent host for this, but you can host it if you like it.

## Running

1. Clone this git repo
2. Download the "Tonight" audio from http://www.lukhash.com/ and put it in www/audio as tonight_full.mp3 and tonight_full.ogg
3. Open index.html in your browser

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome. There is a separate HACKING file which I will try to keep updated with instructions on where to start with modifying the code. If you really get stuck then just ask me at stothardj@gmail.com
