The main file is decaf.coffee in the src directory.
This project uses coffee-toaster to compile. Just install it with npm install -g and then use toaster -c in this directory.
The website uses Jekyll. Install is using gem install jekyll. Then run jekyll from the www directory to compile the webpage.
Run the server with jekyll --server to see it locally
